# Model Challenge: Factors that affect Life Expectancy
The data is collected from the websites of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Bank (WB). The dataset contains annual variables for many of the countries in the world which are divided into several broad categories: immunization related factors, mortality factors, economical factors, and social factors

The goal in this challenge is to find the factors that affect the life expectancy. Specifically, to find out which factors increase the expected life in the countries and which factors decrease it.

## Summary
In this challenge we gathered the information, then we updated the column names to have a standard naming convention. Massaging the data is next. We accomplishing this by locating the missing data and decide do we drop the data or fill in the data with the mean of the dataset. Let's not forget identifying the outliers then finally review the correlation.

## Cause of Mortality
Hepatitis B, Polio, Diphtherua and death cause by Alcohol and the main cause of death in the developed countries. While in developing countries, they have high rate of death caused by Measles and HIV/Aids.

## Countries to Visit
Austria, Malta, Spain, Ireland, Australia, Italy, Netherlands and Sweden, based from the dataset named to have longer life expectancy. We may need more data as to what they eat and do daily to unlock the secrets for a long (longer) life.
